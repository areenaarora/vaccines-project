### mRNA info
#### Source: [CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/different-vaccines/mrna.html)
Vaccines that teach our cells how to make a protein that will trigger an immune response.
CDC recommends Pfizer or Moderna.

The same COVID-19 mRNA vaccine product should be used for both doses of a two-dose primary series and for an additional primary dose, if needed. However, for a booster dose, the booster dose product does not need to match the product used for the primary series.

##### How do mRNA vaccines work?
To trigger an immune response, many vaccines put a weakened germ into our bodies. Instead, mRNA vaccines use mRNA created in a laboratory to teach our cells how to make a protein—or even just a piece of a protein—that triggers an immune response inside our bodies. That immune response, which produces antibodies, is what protects us from getting infected if the real virus enters our bodies.

All COVID-19 vaccine ingredients are safe. Nearly all of the ingredients in COVID-19 vaccines are ingredients found in many foods – fats, sugars, and salts. The Pfizer-BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine also contains a harmless piece of messenger RNA (mRNA).
